              Difference between local storage and session storage??

              <strong>The differences between local storage and session storage </strong>is that sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.Besides localStorage and sessionStorage are relatively new APIs (meaning, not all legacy browsers will support them) and are near identical (both in APIs and capabilities) with the sole exception of persistence. sessionStorage (as the name suggests) is only available for the duration of the browser session (and is deleted when the tab or window is closed) - it does, however, survive page reloads.

              Difference between Global scope and Block scope??

              <strong>The difference between Global scope and Block scope</strong> is  that In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements, and the like.we can say also A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside blocks.On the other block scope is that the block statements (e.g. if conditions or for loops), don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because the variables are still in the same scope.

              <strong>JS event loop works on </strong>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue.

Each event is just a function callback.
